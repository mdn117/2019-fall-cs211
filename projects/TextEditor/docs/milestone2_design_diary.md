For this milestone, I struggled immensely. I had a lot of trouble putting individual words from a file into a vector and trying to get it to word wrap and scroll when the file contents were more than what the window could fit. I couldn't get the logic right at all. However, I was eventually able to load a files contents into a vector, and display what was in the vector. For right now, the file open feature is pressing shift + 'o', and then typing the file name or directory. I couldn't get the command line working. I still have user input from the keyboard working, which is for milestone 3, so I plan to update and document more often in the future. I don't have very much to show in terms of what is actually working on the programming side. What I'm thinking of doing is reworking my entire code and almost starting from scratch, because my logic in the cpp file is making less and less sense the more I add to it. I've been running into a lot of logic problems because of how I designed the code from the first milestone. Here is what I have so far in terms of the file open feature in a gif form:
